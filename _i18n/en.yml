  private_text: "Monero uses a cryptographically sound system that allows you to send and receive funds without your @transactions being publically visible on the @blockchain (the distributed ledger of transactions). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and other transfers remain private by default."
  untraceable_text: "By taking advantage of @ring-signatures, a special property of certain types of cryptography, Monero enables untraceable transactions. This means it's ambiguous which funds have been spent, and thus extremely unlikely that a transaction could be linked to particular user."
  secure_text: "Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer @consensus network, every transaction is cryptographically secured. Individual @accounts have a 25 word @mnemonic-seed displayed when created, which can be written down to back up the @account. Account files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are worthless if stolen."

    mobile_web_lightweight: "Mobile, Web, and Lightweight Clients"
    mobile_web_lightweight_text_1: "The clients below are ideal if you are using Monero for the first time. They are also useful if you are on a device that cannot run a "
    mobile_web_lightweight_text_2: "full Monero node."
    my_monero_text_1: "MyMonero.com"
    my_monero_text_2: " is easy-to-use and works in your browser without you needing to install anything. It can be used with some measure of safety, as MyMonero are unable to spend your funds on your behalf. It is owned and operated by Riccardo Spagni, one of the Monero Core Team members."
    full_client: "Full Monero Client"
    full_client_text: "If you are able to spare the bandwidth and disk space required to run a full node, doing so helps keep the network stable and robust, and also affords you the maximum privacy Monero has to offer."
    monero_node_text_1: "You can read our guide on "

    third_party_clients: "Third-Party Clients"
    third_party_text: "There are also several third-party clients that interact with the official Monero core daemon, and are able to provide their own additional functionality."
    monerox: "MoneroX is a GUI for Monero written in .NET and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is written and maintained by Jojatekok."
    lightwallet: "lightWallet is a simple and slim client written in Python, and should run on most operating systems. It is written and maintained by jwinterm."
  running:
    run_a: "RUN A"
    monero_node: "MONERO NODE"
    why_run: "Why Run a Full Node?"
    why_run_text_1: "Because of the decentralized and peer-to-peer nature of the Monero network it becomes more robust and resilient as it becomes larger. We encourage all users to run a full node, if they are able to."
    why_run_text_2: "Running a Monero node does not require a huge amount of processing power, but it does require a few gigabytes worth of disk space to store the blockchain, and there will be some impact on your bandwidth especially from connected nodes that are catching up on the blockchain."
    why_run_text_3: "The easiest way to run a Monero node, without affecting your home bandwidth, is to purchase a VPS (Virtual Private Server). We strongly recommend [InterServer.net](https://interserver.net/dock/vps-231552.html) using the 'MONERO' coupon code to get a discount over and above their already cheap $6/month VPS. Using this coupon code and/or our [affiliate link](https://interserver.net/dock/vps-231552.html) will also assist in the ongoing funding of Monero development."
    why_run_text_4: "Monero will run on most hardware, including ARM and 32-bit systems. In order to prepare to run the node download the Monero binaries from the [from the downloads page](/downloads)."
    running_node: "Running the Node"
    running_node_text_1: "Once you have the files downloaded and unpacked you don't need to do anything beyond running the Monero daemon."
    running_node_text_2: "- On Windows: locate bitmonerod.exe in Windows Explorer and double-click on it. If it opens and then closes, or crashes after starting, then you may want to start it from within Command Prompt in order to see what errors arise."
    running_node_text_3: "- On OS X: locate bitmonerod in Finder and double-click on it. As with Windows, if it opens and then closes, or crashes after starting, then you can start it from within Terminal."
    running_node_text_4: "- On Linux: dependent on whether you are running it on a desktop or server operating system, you will want to start bitmonerod either in a screen session or in a console window of its own."
    correctly: "Ensuring Your Node is Running Correctly"
    correctly_text_1: "When starting Monero for the first time you will see something similar to this screen:"
    correctly_text_2: "The yellow text indicates it is receiving blocks as it synchronises up with the rest of the Monero network. The green 'synchronized ok' text will appear once it has correctly synched up. Once you see this there's nothing further you need to do, you are now running a Monero node!"
    correctly_text_3: "To exit the node at any time you can type 'exit' into the daemon window and press enter, and it will shut itself down."

  accepting:
    basics: "The Basics"
    basics_text_1: "Monero works a little differently to what you may have become accustomed to from other cryptocurrencies. In the case of a digital currency like Bitcoin and its many derivatives merchant payment systems will usually create a new recipient address for each payment or user."
    basics_text_2: "However, because Monero has stealth addresses there is no need to have separate recipient addresses for each payment or user, and a single account address can be published. Instead, when receiving payments a merchant will provide the person paying with a 'payment ID'."
    basics_text_3: "A payment ID is a hexadecimal string that is 64 characters long, and is normally randomly created by the merchant. An example of a payment ID is: 666c75666679706f6e7920697320746865206265737420706f6e792065766572"
    checking_sw: "Checking for a Payment in simplewallet"
    checking_sw_text_1: "If you want to check for a payment using simplewallet you can use the 'payments' command followed by the payment ID or payment IDs you want to check. For example:"
    checking_sw_text_2: "If you need to check for payments programmatically, then details follow the next section."
    receiving: "Receiving a Payment Step-by-Step"
    receiving_text_1: "Generate a random 64 character hexadecimal string for the payment"
    receiving_text_2: "Communicate the payment ID and Monero address to the individual who is making payment"
    receiving_text_3: "Check for the payment using the 'payments' command in simplewallet"
    checking_prog: "Checking for a Payment Programatically"
    checking_prog_text_1: "In order to check for a payment programatically you can use the get_payments or get_bulk_payments JSON RPC API calls."
    checking_prog_text_2: "get_payments: this requires a payment_id parameter with a single payment ID."
    checking_prog_text_3: "get_bulk_payments: this is the preferred method, and requires two parameters, payment_ids - a JSON array of payment IDs - and an optional min_block_height - the block height to scan from."
    checking_prog_text_4: "An example of returned data is as follows:"
    checking_prog_text_5: "It is important to note that the amounts returned are in base Monero units and not in the display units normally used in end-user applications. Also, since a transaction will typically have multiple outputs that add up to the total required for the payment, the amounts should be grouped by the tx_hash or the payment_id and added together. Additionally, as multiple outputs can have the same amount, it is imperative not to try and filter out the returned data from a single get_bulk_payments call."
    checking_prog_text_6: "Before scanning for payments it is useful to check against the daemon RPC API (the get_info RPC call) to see if additional blocks have been received. Typically you would want to then scan only from that received block on by specifying it as the min_block_height to get_bulk_payments."
    scanning: "Programatically Scanning for Payments"
    scanning_text_1: "Get the current block height from the daemon, only proceed if it has increased since our last scan"
    scanning_text_2: "Call the get_bulk_payments RPC API call with our last scanned height and the list of all payment IDs in our system"
    scanning_text_3: "Store the current block height as our last scanned height"
    scanning_text_4: "Remove duplicates based on transaction hashes we have already received and processed"
