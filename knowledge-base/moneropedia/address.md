### The Basics

When you send Monero to someone you only need one piece of information, and that is their Monero address. A *raw* Monero address is a set of 95 characters starting with a 4. The Monero donation address, for instance, is <span style="word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word;">46BeWrHpwXmHDpDEUmZBWZfoQpdc6HaERCNmx1pEYL2rAcuwufPN9rXHHtyUA4QVy66qeFQkn6sfK8aHYjA3jk3o1Bv16em</span>.

Because those addresses are long and complex you will often encounter an @openalias address instead. For example, Monero donations can be sent to <span style="word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word;">donate@getmonero.org</span> or <span style="word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word;">donate.getmonero.org</span>

If you would like to get an @openalias address of your own then there is some information on the [OpenAlias page](/knowledge-base/openalias).
