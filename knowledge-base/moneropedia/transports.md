### The Basics

@Kovri comes with two encrypted [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) technologies that allow @Kovri to send @messages across the @I2P network. These *@transports* are @SSU and @NTCP.

@SSU is encrypted [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) and @NTCP is encrypted [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol). They both allow you to securely use @I2P over [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcp/ip) connections.
