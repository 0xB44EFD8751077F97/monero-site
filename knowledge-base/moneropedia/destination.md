### The Basics

A destination is the @I2P @in-net address of the final endpoint you are trying to connect to (example: an @I2P website, service, or simply a peer).

### In-depth Information

An @I2P destination can be encoded into a @base32-address or @base64-address. Most users will only care about @base32-address or a `.i2p` hostname while, internally, @Kovri uses @base64-addresses.
