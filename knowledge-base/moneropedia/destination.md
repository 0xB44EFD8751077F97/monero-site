### The Basics

A destination is the @I2P address of the final endpoint you are trying to connect to (an @I2P website or service).

### In-depth Information

An @I2P destination can be encoded into a @base32-address or @base64-address. Most users will only care about @base32-address or a `.i2p` hostname while, internally, @Kovri will use the @base64-address.
