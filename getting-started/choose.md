### Full Monero Client

If you are able to spare the bandwidth and disk space required to run a full node, doing so helps keep the network stable and robust, and also affords you the maximum privacy Monero has to offer.

You have a choice of either the graphical user interface (GUI), which also includes a full node that is built into it, or a command-line interface (CLI) for dedicated or more lightweight systems.
