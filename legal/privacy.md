### What We Collect

The Monero Project uses Google Analytics to collect usage and visitor data for this website. This is enabled via a small piece of JavaScript code, and will not run if you have JavaScript disabled.

We also collect standard server logs from our webserver. We do not use or collect cookies.

### What We Use the Data For

The Google Analytics data is used to provide statistics on the website and help us to improve the content and the information flow.

Server logs are used to analyse errors and diagnose requests to dead links. A portion of the server logs are used to gather statistics on Monero downloads in order to help us better understand our user's needs.
