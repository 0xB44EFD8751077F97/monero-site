## About this Project

This is the Monero website. Instead of using MediaWiki or similar, we are using Jekyll and hosting the source on github. All site content is in the easy-to-use Markdown format, so contributors don't need to have any knowledge of HTML or anything else.

If you would like to suggest changes you can do so by forking the repository, making changes directly on your fork, and then submitting them as pull requests. If you need help doing so feel free to ask for assistance in #monero-dev on Freenode.

Deploying this website requires Jekyll (2.5+) and the 'jekyll/multiple/languages/plugin' plugin (installed by, for example, gem install jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin).
