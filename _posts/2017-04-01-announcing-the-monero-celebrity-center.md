## For Immediate Release

The Monero Core Team is very proud to announce that we have broken ground on the construction of the Monero Celebrity Center in Los Angeles, USA!

For some time we have known that the most relevant of Monero's users, those with the largest number of transactions, are celebrities who are mostly located in the Los Angeles area. We don't know precisely what they're spending Monero on, but we understand their desire for enhanced privacy for certain...purchases...that they make.

It is for this reason that the Monero Core Team have seen to the formation of a special center that caters to these individuals - the artists, politicians, leaders of industry, sports figures and anyone with the power and vision to spend Monero. That center is the Monero Celebrity Center of Los Angeles.

Build on the banks of the Arroyo Calabasas river, the Monero Celebrity Center will be open 24 hours a day, and will house 420 full time staff to assist celebrities and members of the public with their Monero purchases.

Now one might argue that these individuals already have benefits that many will never have. But, ask any one of them - ask yourself - it can become a lonely world. Subject to the unusual pressures that come with prominence and responsibility, being looked upon under a microscope for good or bad - these are burdens others can't imagine. Not to mention the counter-attack such individuals are subjected to by those less-ambitious who would rather fight to maintain a "status quo" than allow another to attempt a change or improvement.

You see, there's no shame in helping the artist. In fact, in the larger scope of societal help, we had better help the artist if we wish to advance the society at all.

We look forward to welcoming you all to the Monero Celebrity Center as soon as it has been completed!
