In this week's podcast we cover external projects, with an interview with the [xmr.to](http://xmr.to) team.

1. [MyMonero](https://mymonero.com) has added existing wallet import functionality. Just use your 25 word mnemonic from simplewallet when logging in, and after paying the 10 XMR once-off fee your wallet will be available in MyMonero.

2. An interview with two members of the xmr.to team, binaryFate and Krongle, discussing some of the system's inner workings and challenges they've faced.

Until next week!
